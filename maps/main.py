#• The first line defines the number of drones using nb_drones: <number>.
#
#• Zone definition on each line using type prefixes:
#    ◦ start_hub: <name> <x> <y> [metadata] marks the starting zone.
#    ◦ end_hub: <name> <x> <y> [metadata] marks the end zone.
#    ◦ hub: <name> <x> <y> [metadata] defines a regular zone.
#    ◦ The connection syntax forbids dashes in zone names (see below).
#
#• All metadata is optional and enclosed in brackets [...] with default values:
#    ◦ zone=<type> (default: normal)
#    ◦ color=<value> (default: none)
#    ◦ max_drones=<number> (default: 1) - Maximum drones that can occupy this
#    zone simultaneously
#    ◦ Tags inside brackets can appear in any order.
#
#• Zone types:
#    ◦ normal – Standard zone with 1 turn movement cost (default)
#    ◦ blocked – Inaccessible zone. Drones must not enter or pass through this zone.
#    Any path using it is invalid.
#    ◦ restricted – A sensitive or dangerous zone. Movement to this zone costs 2
#    turns.
#    ◦ priority – A preferred zone. Movement to this zone costs 1 turn but should
#    be prioritized in pathfinding.
#
#• Colors:
#    ◦ Colors are optional and can be used for visual representation (terminal output
#    or graphical display).
#    ◦ Accepted values for color are any valid single-word strings (e.g., red, blue,
#    gray). There is no fixed list of allowed colors.
#    ◦ When colors are specified, the implementation should provide visual feedback
#    through colored terminal output or graphical representation.
#
#• Connections are defined using connection: <name1>-<name2> [metadata]:
#    ◦ Define a bidirectional connection (edge) between two zones.
#    ◦ The connection syntax forbids dashes in zone names.
#    ◦ Optional metadata can be specified in brackets [...]:
#
#∗ max_link_capacity=<number> (default: 1) - Maximum drones that can
#traverse this connection simultaneously
#
#• Comments start with ’#’ and are ignored.
#The zones coordinates will always be integers, and there will always
#be a unique start and a unique end zone.
